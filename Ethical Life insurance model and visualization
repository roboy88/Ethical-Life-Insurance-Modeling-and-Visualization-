# Ethical Insurance Modeling with AI & Ockham's Razor

This project is a complete, end-to-end pipeline for ethically analyzing and modeling life insurance data using Python, Scikit-learn, and clean visualizations. It is grounded in two core principles:

- **Ockham’s Razor**: Remove unnecessary complexity in the modeling process.
- **Human Dignity**: Introduce ethical metrics like `human_value_score` and `affordability_gap` to treat clients as more than just data points.

## 💡 Project Goals

- Predict insurance charges with interpretable machine learning.
- Segment customer populations into meaningful clusters.
- Design financially sound, ethically centered strategies for outreach and retention.

## 📊 Data Features

Includes features such as:
- `age`, `bmi`, `children`
- `smoker`, `sex`, `region` (encoded)
- `human_value_score`: Inverse risk-based ethical metric
- `affordability_gap`: Difference between actual and predicted "fair" charges
- `customer_retention_rate`, `iul_policy_owner`: Strategic CRM/KPI features

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (Regression, Clustering, Scaling)
- Seaborn / Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab ready

## 📁 Files Included
- `Insurance_Modeling_Ethical_AI.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `cleaned_life_insurance_model.csv`: Cleaned data with features and clusters
- `README.md`: Project description

## 🧠 Usage

1. Upload your insurance CSV with columns like `age`, `bmi`, `charges`, etc.
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Use the visual insights and exported data to guide ethical financial decision-making.
